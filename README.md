# Javascript Practice Exercises

These JavaScript Practice exercises for beginners are mainly focused around string processing and manipulation.  Being exercises for beginners, they're all fairly straightforward.

 We'll be completing 5 JavaScript practice exercises and the first few can be solved with a one line arrow function and the slice function.

It can be handy to practice these JavaScript exercises yourself before seeing the solution so I encourage you to at least try and have an attempt at the JavaScript exercises before seeing how I would have solved them.

If you're a a JavaScript beginner, you'll learn about how to use arrow functions, implicit returns and a lot of string manipulation. Channel Handle @codebubb
